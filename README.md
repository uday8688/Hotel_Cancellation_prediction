# Hotel_Cancellation_prediction

 The cancellation rate for bookings in the online booking industry is quite high. Once the reservation has been cancelled, there is almost nothing to be done.

Therefore, predicting reservations that can be cancelled and preventing these cancellations will create a surplus value for the institutions. I will try to explain how future cancelled reservations can be predicted in advance by machine learning methods.
